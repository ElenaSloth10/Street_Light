                In one cozy city, on one of the narrow winding streets, there
                lived a lantern. He faithfully served his city, lighting the
                road every evening. In the morning he saw fussy people, and in
                the evening illuminated the path for loving couples. The street
                lamp really liked his work. He always greeted his neighbors,
                fellow lanterns. Colleagues stood too far away and there was no
                way to talk to them.
              </p>
              <p class="section-one__text">
                The lantern liked to peer into the sky and every evening he was
                saying goodbye to the sun and then meeting the moon and stars.
                It seemed like they were one big family having fun together. The
                lantern really enjoyed watching them and in cloudy weather he
                missed them very much. On such days, he secretly watched the
                windows of the neighboring house. Someone lived behind each
                window, but what was most touching were the children, who were
                constantly telling each other something and being rowdy. They
                were the ones he envied the most. He was lonely and only
                occasionally had the opportunity to talk with the cheerful birds
                that here and there sat on a lantern.

                One day, schoolchildren planted a linden sapling near him. The
                street lamp was very curious who appeared nearby. And he asked:

              <p class="section-two__text section-two__text-dialogue">
                <span class="section-two__text-replica">- Who are you?</span>

                  >- I am a linden tree</span

              </p>
              <p class="section-two__text">
                From that time on, the street lamp and the linden tree became

                The lantern constantly told the leaves something, and quite
                quickly the seedling grew and turned into a spreading tree and
                began to reach the top of its friend. The leaves were constantly
                whispering, telling funny stories, and the lantern loved them
                very much. But when autumn came and the leaves fell, it made him
                very sad. He was terribly sad all winter, felt lonely again and
                was really looking forward to spring.

              <p class="section-three__text">
                Then the linden tree decided to help its friend. She directed
                her branches towards him and soon the lantern was in her arms.
                So that the lantern would not be so sad.

                And one day a mischievous neighbor settled among the branches -
                a little squirrel. She made herself a hollow and began to live
                in it. The street lamp was very happy with its new resident. And
                soon they became friends. A year later, the squirrel had two
                little children. For the first time, the lantern felt that they
                had a real big family. This is how they still live.
